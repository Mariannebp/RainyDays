## Description

Rainy Days is a website for selling affordable jackets for the average to experienced adventurer, helping you to push the comfort zone.

This project was the first project I got assigned at Noroff. The project was something we were to work on throughout the first year, and add to it with each subject. We started with designing in XD, then creating the HTML and CSS, adding JavaScript, and at the end using wordpress to create an REST API for the products and fetching them to the site.

As I learned about user testing, the site has also been through several rounds of user testing and adjusted accordingly. The user testing was both with Hotjar tracking, in-environment testing, and open feedback.

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Wordpress (API)
