## Description

Rainy Days is a website for selling affordable jackets for the average to experienced adventurer, helping you to push the comfort zone. Here the visitors can get jackets for different weather, seasons and activities. The webiste also features a Inspiration-section where the users themselves can send in pictures and stories from their own trips to inspire others.

This project was the first project I got assigned at Noroff. The project was something we were to work on throughout the first year, and add to it with each subject. The assignment set the target audience to be men and women aged 30 to 50 whose interests are hiking, exploring, skiing, camping, canoeing. The important selling points  were that the jackets were mid-range in price, high durability and comfort, and for them being suitable for a range of different waether types and adventures. We started with designing in XD, then creating the HTML and CSS, adding JavaScript, and at the end using wordpress to create an REST API for the products and fetching them to the site.

As I learned about user testing, the site has also been through several rounds of user testing and been adjusted accordingly. The user testing was conducted with Hotjar tracking, in-environment testing, and open feedback.
